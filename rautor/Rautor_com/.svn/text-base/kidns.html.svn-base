	<h1> KIDNS.EXE </h1>
	<h3>the free child safe DNS enforcing program</h3>
</center>

<a href="http://www.unix.gr/kidns.exe">kidns.exe</a> is a win32 tray application that locks your PC's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS </a>settings to a set of my DNS servers that are configured for <a href="http://www.opendns.com">OPENDNS.COM</a>'s child protection set.

It's characteristics are that:
<ul>
	<li>It copies itself under c:\windows or wherever your %windir% might be.</li>
	<li>It mangles the registry so that it fires up during the PC's start up sequence.</li>
	<li>There is not exit functionality from the tray icon!</li>
	<li>It is resilient to kill from the task manager, meaning that the DNS settings remain if it is killed but not unlocked properly!</li>
</ul>
I have not created an <strong>uninstaller</strong> as of yet since I wanted to make it difficult for children to uninstall it, but removing  it is as easy as pie. To completely remove it do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Delete the application from C:\Windows or wherever your %windir% is.</li>
	<li>Fire up regedit and remove the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\KIDNS .</li>
	<li>Reboot of follow the unlocking procedure.</li>
</ol>
Although the program has not <strong>exit</strong> option, a parent/guardian can <em>unlock</em> the PC by doing the following little song and dance:
<ol>
	<li>Fire up the windows notepad application. Hint: clicking on start-&gt;run type notepad.exe and click OK.</li>
	<li>Visit the Unlock phrase web page at <a href="http://www.unix.gr/kidns.unlock.php">http://www.unix.gr/kidns.unlock.php</a></li>
	<li>Copy this phrase verbatim in the notepad window and voila in a couple of seconds KIDNS will t try to undo all it benefits and announce it too.</li>
</ol>
To better help parents control their children's online behaviour we have configured the following opendns settings automatically for you:

<b>Caveats</b>:<br> Things might get awry if you already have an opendns account.<br>
Do <strong>not</strong> use kidns.exe in a corporate environment where you might have other Name Servers  like the ones for Active Directory.<br>
The unlock phrase is dynamic visit it often. The software is useless against older kids, they are too technologically savvy.

Have fun! Try to visit play_oy.com after intalling kidns.exe :-)
